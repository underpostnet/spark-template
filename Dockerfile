# Stage 2: Create the final runtime image
# We use an official Apache Spark image as the base.
# The Spark version (3.5.3) and Scala version (2.12) MUST match the
# dependencies in build.sbt and the base image tag.

COPY --from=builder /app/target/scala-2.12/spark-scala.jar .

# The image is now ready. The Spark operator will invoke `spark-submit`
# with this image and point it to the JAR file inside.
