# Stage 1: Build the Scala application using sbt
# We use an official sbt image which contains the necessary tools (sbt, jdk).
# The image tag should match the Scala version in build.sbt (2.12.18).

# Copy only the necessary build files first to leverage Docker layer caching.
# This ensures that dependencies are only re-downloaded if build.sbt changes.
COPY build.sbt .
COPY project/build.properties ./project/
COPY project/plugins.sbt ./project/

# This command will trigger sbt to download dependencies.
RUN sbt update

# Now copy the source code
COPY src ./src

# Build the project and create the "fat" JAR file.
RUN sbt assembly


# Stage 2: Create the final runtime image
# We use an official Apache Spark image as the base.
# The Spark version (3.5.3) and Scala version (2.12) MUST match the
# dependencies in build.sbt and the base image tag.
FROM apache/spark:3.5.3-scala2.12-java17-python3-r-ubuntu

# The base image's WORKDIR is /opt/spark/work-dir, which is suitable.
# We copy our application JAR into /opt/spark/jars, which is on the
# default classpath for Spark.
COPY --from=builder /app/target/scala-2.12/spark-template.jar /opt/spark/jars/

# The image is now ready. The Spark operator will invoke `spark-submit`
# with this image and point it to the JAR file inside.
